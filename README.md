!!!  Temporary README   !!!
!!!  subject to change  !!!

Repository with all codes & scripts related to my master thesis taken at CUNI Faculty of Mathematics & Physics in Prague at Insitute of Particle & Nuclear Physics (IPNP). Work is supervised by Doc. Mgr. Franti≈°ek Knapp PhD..

At present time all the scripts use Julia language.

Running code requires these packages:

DelimitedFiles

CGCoefficient

LinearAlgebra


Repository includes:

Spherical Hartree-Fock solver for Even-Even nuclei.

HF based Leading Order Many-Body Perturbation Theory calculation.

Spherical Hartree-Fock Random-Phase Approximation & Tamm-Dancoff Approximation solver for Even-Even nuclei.

Feel free to use & improve the code. Just please credit us whenever you explicitly use parts of the code.
